# Jumpkiq

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sungwoncho/jumpkiq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sungwoncho/jumpkiq) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/sungwoncho/jumpkiq/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/sungwoncho/jumpkiq)

Jumpkiq is a startup MVP (*Minimum Viable Product*) built with Rails and AngularJS.


## Why?

It received some orders and I was having fun. However, I could not assemble a team and decided to move on.


## Some lessons

* Using Stripe to store customer's information and charging them later.
* Using AngularJS for front-end of some parts of the Rails application, powered by RESTful API.
* Namespacing Controllers, routes, and views for APIs and standard HTTP requests.
* Storing sensitive data in the environment variables (Use [fiagro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) gem).
